          By using Supertext you are giving us access to your personal information. In this Privacy
          policy, we will explain what kind of data we collect, how we use this data and for what
          purposes. We will also explain your rights regarding your personal data and how to
          exercise them. Your use of Supertext is to be understood as your acceptance of the terms
          in this Privacy policy. In addition, you accept that we use electronic means of
          communication to send you information. It is important that you read and understand this
          Privacy policy before using Supertext.

      <div class="container max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">1. Definitions</h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-700">
          The words below shall have the following meaning: The Service: The service provided by
          Supertext under these Terms. The User: Persons who use the Service, i.e. everybody who
          sends or receives a message through the Service. Operator: The Users mobile phone
          operator.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6">2. How the service works</h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-700">
          As a User you register a group with the Service and are provided a telephone number. Other
          persons can be connected to this number and thereby become members in the group and Users.
          Messages sent to the group number are automatically forwarded to the other members of the
          group and, in some cases, together with a commercial message. Supertext does not charge
          any fee sending messages to the Service. The only cost per message is the Operators rate
          for sending a message to the groups phone number. The User is aware that other costs may
          be charged if the User uses the Service outside Sweden. The cost for such usage depends on
          the Users agreement with the Operator. Supertext is not party to the agreement between the
          User and the Operator and does not accept responsibility for any cost which may be charged
          by the Operator when the User uses the Service.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6">3. Your responsibilities</h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-700">
          Please use the Service in a responsible and courteous manner. You as User are responsible
          for the content of the messages you send through the Service. As usual, you are required
          to comply with Swedish law. This means that messages containing threats, verbal assaults,
          libel, slander, encouragement to commit crimes and other illegal messages may not be
          spread through the Service. Abuse of the Service is absolutely forbidden, including
          attempting to misuse the service, spread virus, use other Users login credentials or in
          any other way negatively disturb other Users.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6">4. No liability</h2>
        <p class="mt-6">
          Supertext is not to be regarded as any form of legal intermediary between the User and the
          Operator. This means that Supertext assumes no liability for possible disputes between the
          User and the Operator, for example regarding damage, faults or failed payments. Supertext
          accepts no liability for the Users cost for SMS, MMS and telephone traffic as this is
          solely a matter between the User and the Operator. Supertext assumes no responsibility for
          the function and maintenance of the Service and the Service is provided 'As-Is'. The User
          has no rights to claim compensation from Supertext, including, without limitation, demands
          for compensation for economic or other damage due to circumstances connected to the
          Service, such as faulty data, service interruption or banning from the Service under
          Section 11 below. Supertext cannot scrutinize messages before they are published on the
          Service and therefore assumes no responsibility for the content of the messages published
          on the Service.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6">5. Exceptional circumstances</h2>
        <p class="mt-6">
          Supertext shall have no responsibility in case of nonfullfillment of any obligation if the
          nonfullfillment is due to exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances include
          actions or omissions of authorities, new or amended regulations, disease or other decrease
          of work capacity, death, labour conflicts, blockage, fire, floods, loss or damage of data
          or property of importance or major accidents.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6">6. Marketing etc.</h2>
        <p class="mt-6">
